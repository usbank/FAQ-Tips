## Using the APIs

In order utilize the APIs that are exposed through the developer portal, you will need to obtain an API key. This is a unique key code generated for you and will be used to authentication when calling a secure API.

The process for obtaining a key involves the creation of a project on the portal (which will have an API key assigned to it). Then, you link your project to specific APIs which provisions your API key to these APIs.

#### Creating a project

First, you need to go to the project menu which is located under your name on the right side of the title bar.

 In the dialog window, give your project a useful name. You must also select at least one API from the drop down box (listed as "Select products").

 You can also provide a project description if you want. At this time, you can ignore the *Project URL* field. It is a more advanced feature.

 Once you have filled out everything, you can click *Save* and see that your project has now been created.

For this hackathon, you will need to use the API key for authentication. You can see it by clicking the *Show* link on the right.

#### Adding more API products to your project

If you want to add more API products to your project, you will have to do that from the individual API product page. You can easily get to each API product by selecting the *Product* menu on the home page.
