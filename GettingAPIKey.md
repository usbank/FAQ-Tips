# Using the APIs

In order utilize the APIs that are exposed through the developer portal, you will need to obtain an API key. This is a unique key code generated for you and will be used to authentication when calling a secure API.

The process for obtaining a key involves the creation of a project on the portal (which will generate an API key). Then, you link your project to other APIs which basically provisions them to your account.

## Creating a project

**Step 1** In order to create a project, you need to go to the project menu which is located under your name on the right side of the title bar.

 **Step 4** In the dialog window, give your project a useful name. You must also select at least one API from the drop down box (listed as "Select products").

 You can also provide a project description if you want. At this time, you can ignore the *Project URL* field. It is a more advanced feature.

 Once you have filled out everything, you can click *Save* and see that your project has now been created.

For this hackathon, you will need to use both the API key and the secret for authentication. You can see these values by clicking the *Show* link on the right.

## Adding more API products to your project

In general, you will want to add all of the APIs to your project so that you can use them within your application. In order to do this, you will need to go to each API product page and add it manually. You can easily get to each API product by selecting the *Product* menu on the home page.

**Step 3** Select your project name from the drop down box and click *Save* to associate this API product to it. You will now see that this API has been added to your project.
